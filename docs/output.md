# nf-core/molkart: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [Mindagap](#Mindagap) - Fill empty grid lines in a panorama image with neighbor-weighted values.
- [CLAHE](#CLAHE) - perform contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization.
- [Create stacks](#create_stacks) - If a second image is provided, combine both into one stack as input for segmentation modules.
- [segmentation](#segmentation) - Segment single cells from provided image using segmentation method of choice (Cellpose, Mesmer, ilastik) and filter them by size.
- [Mindagap_duplicatefinder](#Mindagap) - Take a spot table and search for duplicates along grid lines.
- [Spot2cell](#spot2cell) - Assign non-duplicated spots to segmented cells based on segmentation mask and extract cell shape information.
- [Create AnnData](#anndata) - Creates a spatial AnnData object as described in the [Squidpy tutorial](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/tutorials/tutorial_read_spatial.html).
- [MolkartQC](#molkartqc) - Produce QC metrics specific to this pipeline.
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline.
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution.

- [Create training subset](#create-training-subset) - creates crops for segmentation training (Cellpose, ilastik).

### Mindagap

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `mindagap/`
  - `*_gridfilled.tiff`: Gridfilled panorama file(s).
  - `*_markedDups.txt`: Spot table with duplicated spots marked as 'Duplicated'.

</details>

[Mindagap](https://github.com/ViriatoII/MindaGap) fills empty grids of a panorama made from several tiles using the mean of the immediate neighborhood, as well as marking duplicated spots near the grid from the spot table.

### CLAHE

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `clahe/`
  - `*_clahe.tiff`: Image with contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization applied.

</details>

[CLAHE](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.exposure.html#skimage.exposure.equalize_adapthist) is a algorithm from [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) for local contrast enhancement, that uses histograms computed over different tile regions of the image. Local details can therefore be enhanced even in regions that are darker or lighter than most of the image.

### Create_stacks

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `stack/`
  - `*.ome.tif`: Image containing provided input images as channels.

</details>

Create stack is a local module used to merge images into a stack as preparation for segmentation processes.

### Segmentation

  - `filtered_masks/` - `*_method_filtered.tif`: Segmentation masks filtered based on provided area limits.
  </details>

[Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org) is a segmentation tool that provides pretrained models as well as additional human-in-the loop training. If additional training is performed, the envisioned way of doing it is creating the training subset (`TIFF`), and training the model in the [Cellpose GUI](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gui.html) on the subset, then giving the trained model as an argument within the pipeline to complete the pipeline run.

[ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org) is an interactive learning and segmentation toolkit, with its application here envisioned as - create training subset (`hdf5`), create Pixel Classifier and Boundary prediction with Multicut projects with specified parameters. Within Molkart, the project files can be given and batch processing would be applied on the full images.

[Mesmer](https://deepcell.readthedocs.io/en/master/API/deepcell.applications.html#mesmer) is a segmentation tool that provides pretrained models for whole-cell and nuclear segmentation.

[Stardist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) is an object detection tool using star-convex shapes.

### Spot2cell

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `spot2cell/`
  - `*.cellxgene.csv`: Cell-by-transcript `csv` file containing transcript counts per cell, as well as cell shape properties.

</details>

Spot2cell is a local module that assigns spots (without Duplicates) to cells via a spot table and segmentation mask.

### Create_anndata

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `anndata/`
  - `*.adata`: Anndata object containing the spot count table, spatial locations of cells in `adata.obsm` and metadata like 'Area', 'MajorAxisLength', 'MinorAxisLength', 'Eccentricity', 'Solidity', 'Extent', 'Orientation' in `adata.obs`

MolkartQC is a local module used for gathering useful quality-control metrics for spot-based image processing methods, including: sample ID, used segmentation method, total number of cells, average cell area, total number of spots, average spot assignment per cell, total number of assigned spots, percentage of assigned spots, number of duplicated spots.

### MultiQC

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### create-training-subset

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `training_subset/`
  - `hdf5/`

  - `tiff/`
    - `*_crop[0-9]+.tiff`: `TIFF` crops for training Cellpose to create a custom segmentation model.

</details>

Create training subset is an optional group of modules that create crops in `HDF5` and `TIFF` formats, as well as provide the crop overview for reusability.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameters are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
